> I really want to try to add some 3d animations to my iOS and Android mobile app built with Titanium SDK.  Specifically, I am trying to recreate the Star Wars intro with the scrolling text for May the 4th.  I need it to work on both iOS and Android so any guidance you can give me would be very helpful!
